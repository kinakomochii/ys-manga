  "description": "Ten years have passed since Takuma lost touch with his good friend Yuki, who left for Italy to become a Cellist. Now working as a home aid, Takuma is shocked to find his next patient is none other than Yuki himself. After an accident, Yuki is now semi-blind. His eyes are trapped behind bandages until the time he undergoes surgery. Due to mixed feelings about their reunion, Takuma keeps his identity a secret as he tends to the injured Yuki. But how will Takuma react when he learns that his friend was in love with someone when they were kidsâ€¦ and still holds a torch for that person even now? (Vol. 5 tells the story of violinist Noel and his manager Donald.)",
