  "description": "Since entering university, Izumi has been approached by strangers on campus. It seems like there's another 'Izumi' who wears glasses just like him, and he recklessly takes on other people's requests. In an unexpected turn of events, he got to know this Izumi, so he started following him around to prevent people from mistaking them... A slow, quiet, heartful, twilight romance.",
