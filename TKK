  "description": "Eichi is a university student who likes to hang around flashy people. He is irritated by the fact that Jinno is always silently staring at him without saying anything every time they meet at a drinking party. Eichi successfully gets Jinno drunk to the point of getting sick one night â€“ however, he is unexpectedly appointed to look after him. Not only that, Jinno pounces him while at the pub's toilet?!",
