  "description": "Two years after being served divorce papers by his wife on Christmas Day, Itsuki is still dwelling on the past, unable to move on. Having drunk himself into oblivion, he wanders into a gay bar where he meets Minato for the first time. Spurred by the influence of alcohol, the two end up in bed together, but athough Itsuki is unable to forget their encounter, his advances are ignored by the seemingly indifferent Minato.",
